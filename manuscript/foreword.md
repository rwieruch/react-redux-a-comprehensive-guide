# Foreword

The Road to learn React teaches you the fundamentals of React. You will build a real world application along the way in plain React without complicated tooling. Everything from project setup to deployment on a server will be explained for you. The book comes with additional referenced reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by me and the community.

In the Road to learn React, I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the broader React ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information about React. It explains general concepts, patterns and best practices in a real world React application.

You will learn to build your own React application. It covers real world features like pagination, client-side caching and interactions such as searching and sorting. Additionally, you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 along the way. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript and helps you to get started with it.

# About the Author

Robin Wieruch is a german software and web engineer who is dedicated to learn and teach programming in JavaScript. After graduating from university with a masters degree in computer science, he hasn't stopped learning every day on his own. His experiences from the startup world, where he used JavaScript excessively during his professional time and spare time, gave him the opportunity to teach others about these topics.

For a few years, Robin worked closely with a great team of engineers at a company called Small Improvements on a large scale application. The company builds a SaaS product enabling customers to create a feedback culture at their company. Under the hood, the application worked with JavaScript in the frontend and Java in the backend. In the frontend, the first iteration was written in Java with the Wicket Framework and jQuery. When the first generation of SPAs became popular, the company migrated to Angular 1.x for the frontend application. After using Angular for more than 2 years, it became clear that Angular wasn't the best solution to work with state intense applications back in the days. That's why the company made the final jump to React and Redux that has enabled it to operate on a large scale successfully.

During his time in the company, Robin regularly wrote articles about web development on his personal website. He noticed that people would give him great feedback on his articles that allowed him to improve his writing and teaching style. Article after article, Robin grew in his ability to teach others. Whereas the first article was packed with too much stuff that could be quite overwhelming for students, the articles improved over time by focussing and teaching only one subject.

Nowadays, Robin is self-employed to teach others. He finds it a fulfilling activity to see students thrive by giving them clear objectives and a short feedback loop. That's one thing you would learn at a feedback company, wouldn't you? But without coding himself he wouldn't be able to teach things. That's why he invests his remaining time in programming. You can find more information about Robin and ways to support and work with him on his [website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about).

# Testimonials

There are many [testimonials](https://roadtoreact.com/), [ratings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37503118-the-road-to-learn-react) and [reviews](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HJFCQX) about the book which should confirm the quality of it. I am so proud of it, because I never expected such an overwhelming feedback. If you enjoy the book as well, I would love to find your rating/review somewhere as well. It helps me to spread the word about the book. The following shows a short excerpt of these good voices:

**[Muhammad Kashif](https://twitter.com/appsdevpk/status/848625244956901376):** "The Road to Learn React is a unique book that I recommend to any student or professional interested in learning react basics to advanced level. It is packed with insightful tips and techniques that are hard to find elsewhere, and remarkably thorough in its use of examples and references to sample problems, i have 17 years of experience in web and desktop app development, and before reading this book i was having trouble in learning react, but this book works like magic."

**[Andre Vargas](https://twitter.com/andrevar66/status/853789166987038720):** "The Road to Learn React by Robin Wieruch is such an awesome book! Most of what I learned about React and even ES6 was through it!"

**[Nicholas Hunt-Walker, Instructor of Python at a Seattle Coding School](https://twitter.com/nhuntwalker/status/845730837823840256):** "This is one of the most well-written & informative coding books I've ever worked through. A solid React & ES6 introduction."

**[Austin Green](https://twitter.com/AustinGreen/status/845321540627521536):** "Thanks, really loved the book. Perfect blend to learn React, ES6, and higher level programming concepts."

**[Nicole Ferguson](https://twitter.com/nicoleffe/status/833488391148822528):** "I'm doing Robin's Road to Learn React course this weekend & I almost feel guilty for having so much fun."

**[Karan](https://twitter.com/kvss1992/status/889197346344493056):** "Just finished your Road to React. Best book for a beginner in the world of React and JS. Elegant exposure to ES. Kudos! :)"

**[Eric Priou](https://twitter.com/erixtekila/status/840875459730657283):** "The Road to learn React by Robin Wieruch is a must read. Clean and concise for React and JavaScript."

**A Rookie Developer:** "I just finished the book as a rookie developer, thanks for working on this. It was easy to follow and I feel confident in starting a new app from scratch in the coming days. The book was much better than official React.js tutorial that I tried earlier (and couldn't complete due to lack of detail). The exercises at the end of each section were very rewarding."

**Student:** "The best book to start learning ReactJS. The project moves along with the concepts being learnt which helps to grasp the subject. I have found 'Code and learn' as best way to master programming and this book exactly does that."

**[Thomas Lockney](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1880673388):** "Pretty solid introduction to React that doesn't try to be comprehensive. I just wanted a taste to understand what it was about and this book gave me exactly that. I didn't follow all the little footnotes to learn about the new ES6 features I've missed ("I wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob."). But I'm sure for those of you who have fallen behind and are diligent about following those, you can probably learn a lot more than just what the book teaches."

# Education for Children

The book should enable everyone to learn React. However, not everyone is privileged to use those resources, because not everyone is educated in the English language in the first place. Thus I want to use the project to support projects that teach children English in the developing world.

# FAQ

**How to get updates?** I have two channels where I share updates about my content. Either you can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share qualitative content. You will never receive any spam. Once you get the update that the book has changed, you can download the new version of it.

**Does it use the recent React version?** The book always receives an update when the React version got updated. Usually books are outdated pretty soon after their release. Since this book is self-published, I can update it whenever I want.

**Does it cover Redux?** It doesn't. Therefore I have written a second book. The Road to learn React should give you a solid foundation before you dive into advanced topics. The implementation of the sample application in the book will show that you don't need Redux to build an application in React. After you have read the book, you should be able to implement a solid application without Redux. Then you can read my second book, Taming the State in React, to learn [Redux](https://roadtoreact.com).

**Does it use JavaScript ES6?** Yes. But don't worry. You will be fine if you are familiar with JavaScript ES5. All JavaScript ES6 features, that I describe on the journey to learn React, will transition from ES5 to ES6 in the book. Every feature along the way will be explained. The book does not only teach React, but also all useful JavaScript ES6 features for React.

**How to get access to the source code projects and screencasts series?** If you have bought one of the extended packages that gives you access to the source code projects, screencast series or any other addon, you should find these on your [course dashboard](https://roadtoreact.com/my-courses). If you have bought the course somewhere else than on [the official Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com) course platform, you need to create an account on the platform, go to the Admin page and reach out to me with one of the email templates. Afterward I can enroll you to the course. If you haven't bought one of the extended packages, you can reach out any time to upgrade your content to access the source code projects and screencast series.

**How can I get help while reading the book?** The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who are reading the book. You can join the channel to get help or to help others. After all, helping others can internalize your learnings, too. If there is no one out to help you, you can always reach out to me.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?** If you run into problems, please join the Slack Group. In addition, you could have a look into the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react/issues) for the book. Perhaps your problem was already mentioned and you can find the solution for it. If your problem wasn't mentioned, don't hesitate to open a new issue where you can explain your problem, maybe provide a screenshot, and some more details (e.g. book page, node version). After all, I try to ship all fixes in next editions of the book.

**Can I help to improve the content?** Yes, I would love to hear your feedback. You can simply open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react). These can be improvements technical wise yet also about the written word. I am no native speaker that's why any help is appreciated. You can open pull requests on the GitHub page as well.

**Is there a money back guarantee?** Yes, there is 100% money back guarantee for two months if you don't think it's a good fit. Please reach out to me to get a refund.

**How to support the project?** If you believe in the content that I create, you can [support me](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/). Furthermore, I would be grateful if you spread the word about this book after you read it and enjoyed reading it. Furthermore, I would love to have you as my [Patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch).

**What's your motivation behind the book?** I want to teach about this topic in a consistent way. You often find material online that doesn't receive any updates or only teaches a small part of a topic. When you learn something new, people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to give you this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. In addition, I hope I can support minorities with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). In addition, in the recent time, I found myself fulfilled when teaching others about programming. It's a meaningful activity for me that I prefer over any other 9 to 5 job at any company. That's why I hope to pursue this path in the future.

**Is there a call to action?** Yes. I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match to learn React. The person could have shown the interest already, could be in the middle of learning React or might not yet be aware about wanting to learn React. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others.

# How to read it?

The book is my attempt to teach React while you will write an application. It is a practical guide to learn React and not a reference work about React. You will write a Hacker News application that interacts with a real world API. Among several interesting topics, it covers state management in React, caching and interactions (sorting and searching). On the way you will learn best practices and patterns in React.

In addition, the book gives you a transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. React embraces a lot of JavaScript ES6 features and I want to show you how you can use them.

In general, each chapter of the book will build up on the previous chapter. Each chapter will teach you something new. Don't rush through the book. You should internalize each step. You could apply your own implementations and read more about the topic. After each chapter I give you some reading material and exercises. If you really want to learn React, I highly recommend to read the extra material and do some hands on exercises. After you have read a chapter, make yourself comfortable with the learnings before you continue.

In the end, you will have a complete React application in production. I am very keen to see your results, so please text me when you have finished the book. The final chapter of the book will give you a handful of options to continue your React journey. In general you will find a lot of React related topics on [my personal website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/).

Since you are reading the book, I guess you are new to React. That's perfect. In the end, I hope to get your feedback to improve the material to enable everyone to learn React. You can have a direct impact on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react) or text me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch).
